# 🛠️ AI-Powered Requirements Engineering Backend

This backend helps teams transform raw project ideas into a **validated, conflict-free, and prioritized blueprint** by leveraging multiple AI agents (powered by Gemini/Grok APIs).  

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Session-based workflow** → keeps context across steps.  
- **AI Agents** → clarify, validate, resolve conflicts, and prioritize requirements.  
- **Final Blueprint** → export-ready project specification.  
- **Scalable Architecture** → supports caching, rate limiting, and background jobs.  

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js + Express  
- **Database**: MongoDB + Mongoose  
- **AI APIs**: Gemini API, Grok API  
- **Optional Enhancements**:  
  - `express-rate-limit` → prevent abuse  
  - `redis` → caching repeated AI calls  
  - `bullmq` → background jobs for heavy tasks  
  - `winston` / `pino` → structured logging

## 🌐 API Routes

### 1. **Session Management**
`POST /api/session/start`  
Starts a new session and initializes database entry.  

**Input**
```json
{ "userIdea": "I want to build a Gen Z e-commerce platform" }
````

**Output**

```json
{
  "sessionId": "65fdc39...",
  "status": "started",
  "message": "Session created. Next: run clarifier agent."
}
```

---

### 2. **Clarifier Agent**

`POST /api/agents/clarifier`
Generates clarifying questions & refined requirements.

**Output Example**

```json
{
  "questions": [
    "What specific age range are you targeting?",
    "What makes you different from Amazon?"
  ],
  "draftRequirements": { ... }
}
```

---

### 3. **Conflict Resolver Agent**

`POST /api/agents/conflict-resolver`
Detects logical contradictions and suggests resolutions.

**Output Example**

```json
{
  "conflicts": [
    {
      "issue": "Minimalist design vs infinite scroll feed",
      "options": [
        "Keep minimalist: drop social feed",
        "Emphasize engagement: integrate reels feature"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 4. **Validator Agent**

`POST /api/agents/validator`
Runs feasibility checks (tech, market, business).

**Output Example**

```json
{
  "feasibilityReport": {
    "technical": "Realtime inventory is high complexity.",
    "market": "Gamified shopping is trending.",
    "business": "Aligns with retention goals."
  },
  "riskLevel": "medium"
}
```

---

### 5. **Prioritizer Agent**

`POST /api/agents/prioritizer`
Organizes requirements into roadmap.

**Output Example**

```json
{
  "mustHave": ["Product listings", "Checkout system"],
  "shouldHave": ["User profiles"],
  "niceToHave": ["Loyalty program"]
}
```

---

### 6. **Final Blueprint**

`GET /api/session/:id/blueprint`
Returns merged, validated project blueprint.

**Output Example**

```json
{
  "projectName": "Gen Z E-Commerce",
  "problemStatement": "...",
  "requirements": { ... },
  "conflictsResolved": { ... },
  "feasibilityReport": { ... },
  "roadmap": { ... }
}
```

---

## 🧭 Workflow

```
/session/start 
   → /agents/clarifier 
   → /agents/conflict-resolver 
   → /agents/validator 
   → /agents/prioritizer 
   → /session/:id/blueprint
```

---

## ✨ Nice-to-Haves

* Conversation history for context.
* Streaming responses for interactive feel.
* Confidence scores on feasibility checks.
* Effort vs Impact matrix for prioritization.
* Export → PDF, DOCX, Jira/Trello sync.
* Webhooks → auto-send blueprint to Slack/Notion.
* Analytics dashboard for monitoring usage.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-backend.git
cd your-backend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/requirements-db
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
GROK_API_KEY=your_grok_key
```

### 4. Run Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Server will run at: `http://localhost:5000`
